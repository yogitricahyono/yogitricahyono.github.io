I was studying in Tenth November Institute of Technology. My final project was developing an desktop application of abnormal consumption pattern analysis of local state drinking water company's customer in Surabaya, East Java. [This project](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yogitricahyono/detail/treasury/education:292738229/?entityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_treasuryMedia%3A(ACoAABjzc9MBCzUTATlUs1ar88KICWynLGW1rUw%2C1546480141013)&section=education%3A292738229&treasuryCount=4) was intended to detect fraudster based on their water consumption behaviour instead of field-investigating every single of the customer. My thesis was supervised by Arif Djunaidy.
